Exploratory scripts for comparing various funnels, and identifying the best funnel by desired measurement.

Measures can include conversion rate, conversion time, or a distribution of both.

The state of funnels can include:
1. Funnels with the same stage types and the same stage ordering
2. Funnels with different stage types and similar ordering
3. Funnels with the same stage types and differnt ordering
4. Funnels with different stage types anf different ordering

additional considerations:
- Applicant movement may not always be in fixed order, i.e. movement from stage 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
- There may be repeats of stages, i.e. movement from stage 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4
- Funnels may have varying number of stages
- It is the user's responsibility to compare like-to-like, i.e. don't include funnel C if materially different from A, B
- Applicants may still be moving through the funnel, i.e. not yet existed
