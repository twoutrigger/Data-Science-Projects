The mixed doubles competition was expanded for its second appearance in the Olympics.[2] A total of 120 quota spots (60 per sex) were distributed to the sport of curling, an increase of four from the 2018 Winter Olympics.[3] A total of 3 events were contested, one for men, one for women, and one mixed.[4]\n",

    "Qualification to the Men's and Women's curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods (in addition to the host nation). Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 World Curling Championships. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.[5]\n",

This OQE was open to a nominated host and the fifteen nations with the highest qualification points not already qualified to the Olympics. As the host nation, China qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per event in the curling tournaments.[6]\n",
