1. Order Picking Accuracy
- Out of all the orders picked, what percentage of them were picked accurately.
- Number of correctly picked items divided by total number of picked items.

2. Days on hand
- How many days an item has been sitting on a shelf. Items that sit too long on the shelf costs the company money.
- Similar to applicant idle time.

3. Freight Cost Per Unit
- Cost of shipping items to the factories.
- Bundling orders as a potential means of saving on cost.

4. Cash to Cash Cycle Time 
- Measures days between paying for inventory to get into the warehouse, before it gets shipped out.

5. Inventory Turnover
- Measures how many times per year the warehouse goes through the entire (or x% of the) inventory. 

6. Inventory Accuracy
- How often your system says something is in stock, when it in fact isn't?

7. Truck time at the dock
- Trucks spending too much time at the dock  indicates potential staffing, inventory, or infrastructure issues.

8. Cost per line item shipped
- How much does it cost to ship one item (or one bundle) to a customer?

9. Time to Receiving and Pick Location
- Measure time for intake of inventory. How long does it take the staff to unload trucks and get the product to the right place in the warehouse?

10. Carrying cost of inventory
- A sum of cost at each stage, such as receiving costs, storage cost, packing cost. Higher the total cost, lower the margins.

11. Backorder rate
- This is the rate which incoming orders come for out-of-stock items. This usually indicates a failure to accurately forecast sales. It could also spike with seasonal demand.

12. Order lead time
- The total time it takes to fulfill an order, including picking, packing, and shipping. Shipping can be excluding as it is usually out of the hands of the warehouse.

13. Revenue per employee
- Tracking labor costs is important, as they are often the highest non-inventory cost for a warehouse. Each employee will generate revenue through activities that keep the other KPIs where they need to be. That revenue should exceed the total amount that employee is paid (including benefits).

14. Order damage rate
- Damaged goods should be noted the same way as inaccurate orders. There is usually some acceptable level of breakage for items (usually about 1%).

15. Sales-to-inventory ratio
- Inventory turnover measures your inventory’s velocity over the course of time. An alternative measure is to see how much value is tied up in inventory vs. moving out the door. To do this, you divide the cost of goods sold by the average value of your inventory. The closer this number is to 100%, the better. Too low? Items are not moving. Too high? Items are selling faster than you can restock them.

16. Total cost of storage
- This measures the amount of money “leaking out” as your items sit on the shelf or pallet. It includes things like warehouse space leased (if you are leasing), insurance costs, climate control costs, utilities, security, and so on.

17. Orders picked per hour
- Tracking orders picked per hour over time gives you a rough idea of how efficient your pickers are, which is useful for a number of things. Changes in this number from shift to shift can tell you, for example, when there are problems with a given team or manager.

18. Percentage on-time full delivery
- Percentage on-time full delivery is the percentage you get right (i.e., not late) over total number of orders delivered.
